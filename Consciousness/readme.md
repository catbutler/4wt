Consciousness enables subjective experience. Any conscious being has subjective experiences. Subjective experiences by their nature cannot be directly shared, and in humans at least, have variable fidelity in self-reports.

Science has created various objectively observable proxies for consciousness, but these in principle could be satisfied by non-conscious behavior. Likewise, science provides various proxies for fidelity of self-reporting, but these also fail to provide a distinct and sufficient measurement of the subjective experience itself, and to varying but significant extents can be dampened or controlled by a practiced subject.

However, consciousness is a standard by which we make many ethical decisions - you don't want to be a conscious being that humans don't consider conscious.
