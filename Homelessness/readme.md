# Homelessness in America
## Definitions
- __Homeless__
-- Lacking stable residence in legal shelter, a homeless person thereby lacks "the comforts of home" - a flexible list involving (at a minimum) insulated shelter, electric power and basic appliances, running hot and cold fresh water, functional sanitation (private or public), private personal quarters with controlled access, access to laundry facilities, access to kitchen facilities, and access to shared private living space.
- __Homelessness__
-- Prevalence, distribution, and subjective conditions of homeless Americans.
- __Stakeholders__
-- Homeless people, property owners of record for sites occupied by homeless people, civil authorities, charitable organizations
## Questions
- __Cause or consequence?__
-- Is homelessness attributable (can it be entirely attributed to someone or something), and if so, is it a primary cause or a consequence (does homelessness happen arbitrarily or does something else cause it)?
-- Why does it matter? If homelessness is not entirely attributable, solutions must iterate, continuously welcome input from stakeholders, and pursue clear, measurable goals that essentially represent their interests.
