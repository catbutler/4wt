1. [A degree-by-degree explanation of what will happen when the earth warms](http://globalwarming.berrens.nl/globalwarming.htm) asserts:

> Beyond two degrees, however, preventing mass starvation will be as easy as halting the cycles of the moon. First millions, then billions, of people will face an increasingly tough battle to survive.

>To find anything comparable we have to go back to the Pliocene – last epoch of the Tertiary period, 3m years ago. There were no continental glaciers in the northern hemisphere (trees grew in the Arctic), and sea levels were 25 metres higher than today’s. In this kind of heat, the death of the Amazon is as inevitable as the melting of Greenland.

## Well what's wrong with that?
- The Amazon channel has existed and supported trees since the Cretaceous, although it ran west into the Pacific until the rise of the Andes. The Amazon rainforest itself is 11 million years old - meaning it clearly survived the Pliocene.
-- [Amazon River - Geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River#Geology)
- Pliocene Earth had forests at almost every latitude, larger continental shelves with enormous ecosystems, fewer, smaller deserts (yes, reconstructions show some deserts where we now have grasslands or savanna, including in the Dust Bowl - but the Desert Southwest featured savanna and montane forest), and in general more area suitable for human civilization.

2. [Future of the human climate niche](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/21/11350) begins:

> We show that for thousands of years, humans have concentrated in a surprisingly narrow subset of Earth’s available climates, characterized by mean annual temperatures around ∼13 °C. This distribution likely reflects a human temperature niche related to fundamental constraints. We demonstrate that depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, over the coming 50 y, 1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 y. Absent climate mitigation or migration, a substantial part of humanity will be exposed to mean annual temperatures warmer than nearly anywhere today.

## 4wt?
- It assumes _mean annual temperature_ is a full proxy for "climate conditions" and by itself __predicts__ human habitation.
- Defining four periods, it uses the same time-frame definitions in both datasets for the reconstructed periods/cohorts, one for climate and one for habitation. But it uses different definitions for _Current_.
-- For habitation, _Current_ means from 2000-2015
-- For climate, _Current_ means:
>  The climate data for the current conditions (representative of 1960-
1990) were generated from interpolated weather station data.

However, between 1960 and 1990, MAT rose 0.3C (0.1 -> 0.4) and at times the change was negative; between 2000 and 2015, MAT rose steadily from 0.4C above baseline to 0.9C, a 0.5C increase. If the effect of MAT is real, recent populations concentrate in areas with MAT 0.5C hotter than the figures and charts in the study. IOW, a third of the catastrophe has already unfolded.
