1. (A degree-by-degree explanation of what will happen when the earth warms)[http://globalwarming.berrens.nl/globalwarming.htm] asserts:

> Beyond two degrees, however, preventing mass starvation will be as easy as halting the cycles of the moon. First millions, then billions, of people will face an increasingly tough battle to survive.

>To find anything comparable we have to go back to the Pliocene – last epoch of the Tertiary period, 3m years ago. There were no continental glaciers in the northern hemisphere (trees grew in the Arctic), and sea levels were 25 metres higher than today’s. In this kind of heat, the death of the Amazon is as inevitable as the melting of Greenland.

## Well what's wrong with that?
- The Amazon channel has existed and supported trees since the Cretaceous, although it ran west into the Pacific until the rise of the Andes. The Amazon rainforest itself is 11 million years old - meaning it clearly survived the Pliocene.

- Pliocene Earth had forests at almost every latitude, larger continental shelves with enormous ecosystems, fewer, smaller deserts (yes, reconstructions show some deserts where we now have grasslands or savanna, including in the Dust Bowl - but the Desert Southwest featured savanna and montane forest), and in general more area suitable for human civilization.
