Private access to military technology is controlled in modern political systems, with highly variable implementation among powers-that-be.

In the USA, the 2nd Amendment establishes that "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed." What that means exactly has never been a matter of consensus, but the divide of opinions widens over time. The core question is whether it confers rights to all people or only to members of a "well-regulated militia" (based on the reading of "the people" -whether it refers to individuals or the body politic), but "Arms" is another axis of difference (currently the debate is centered on options that presume "Arms" refers to handheld blades, bows, and guns, and excludes all other means of violence such as artillery, corrosive or toxic chemicals, nuclear missiles, and assault vehicles of any sort).
