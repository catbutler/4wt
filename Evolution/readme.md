We love to point to evolution as evidence of our special status among terrestrial biota. We arrange species across paleohistory in a branched tree representing various evolved species and their descendants. We upend  this branched chart into a hierarchy of sorts, and periodically define and redefine various levels of that hierarchy. We're always at the top, of course, and in ways we totally deserve that. But it's a biased arrangement of biased observations, and we can't even know all the biases at play.
